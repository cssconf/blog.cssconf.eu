It’s usually around this time of the year that we reveal our plans for the next CSSconf EU, so here it goes:

We’re thrilled to announce **CSSconf EU 2017**! That’s right, [together with JSConf EU](), CSSconf EU is pressing the pause button in 2016 and will return only a few months later than usual in **spring 2017**.

It’s been a fantastic three years running CSSconf EU, learning a lot with each event and using it to improve the next. CSSconf EU 2015 [was magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO-ypk8HOfg), it topped expectations and we are all really happy and proud to have taken part in its making. Yet the organization and running of a conference is a taxing endeavour. Like [JSConf EU](http://2015.jsconf.eu/), CSSconf EU is organized by volunteers who dedicate much of their spare time to deliver the best event possible. After three years we feel a little worn out. So, we've agreed that now would be a good time to take a break, recharge, and come back better than ever!

There are many wonderful events out there that will be taking place in 2016 and that we’re looking forward to: [CSSconf Budapest](http://cssconfbp.rocks/) recently opened their CfS, and [CSSconf Nordic](http://cssconf.no/) is kicking off for the first time ever in summer 2016! And if you find yourselves in Berlin, you can always swing by [Up.front](http://up.front.ug/).
