## Diversity Support Tickets

Once again, we are offering [Diversity Support Tickets](http://2017.cssconf.eu/diversity-support-tickets/) for CSSconf EU. When you buy a Diversity Support Ticket, you are purchasing a ticket for yourself and [helping another person](http://blog.cssconf.eu/2015/07/07/interview-jenny-kathambi-cssconfeu-scholarships/) who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend the conference.

There is a range of support options available: you can contribute from just 25% of a ticket to a full one. We thank you in advance for your generosity and awesomeness and look forward to the most diverse CSSconf EU yet.

## What your ticket buys you

Your ticket buys you entrance to the conference on May 5 2017, including full catering (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and drinks).
Your ticket also guarantees you entrance to all social events around the conference, including the parties of JSConf EU on Saturday & Sunday, May 6-7, as well as relax.js the following Monday, May 8.

## Pricing

We will sell tickets in multiple batches over the coming weeks to give everyone a chance to purchase theirs. The initial batch of tickets will be available for 285€ + VAT + Fees: 349€. Future batches will sell starting at 330€ + VAT + Fees: 399€

Please find [pricing for additional ticket options](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2017) on tito.

## Will there be combo tickets with JSConf EU?
