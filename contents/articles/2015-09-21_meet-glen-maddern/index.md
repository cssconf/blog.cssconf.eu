Glen is an independent web developer from Melbourne, Australia where he organizes [CSSConf AU](http://2015.cssconf.com.au/) and does rad web stuff.

Glen’s talk, ​**_Interoperable CSS_**​, will introduce you to a new low-level interchange format for CSS that is already supported by default in loaders like Webpack & JSPM. It enables CSS Modules and it hopes to do for CSS what CommonJS did for JavaScript.

We approached Glen to ask him about work, CSS, and speaking at conferences:

<span class="strong-border">Hi Glen! Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions for us. Besides being busy speaking at and organizing conferences, what are you up to at the moment?</span>
Well, the popularity of CSS Modules really took us all by surprise, so there’s a bunch of new people coming to the project & asking questions. It’s really awesome to see, but this is the biggest open-source project I’ve been involved in, and it’s surprising just how much time it takes to keep on top of.

<span class="strong-border">What does a Glen Maddern work day look like?</span>
I’m a freelancer, so my “usual work day” depends on the client. For the last few months that’s been fully remote — I’m working for a government team up in Sydney, building a WebRTC application for remote health consultations. I’ve set up an awesome space in Melbourne with some other remote web people, so day-to-day we’re all in there just like in a normal office, except none of us work on anything together. One day I’m going to blog about why I think that beats normal co-working spaces, just as soon as I get a free moment...

<span class="strong-border">An upcoming CSS feature you can’t wait to see widely supported by browsers is...</span>
👏 V 👏 A 👏 R 👏 I 👏 A 👏 B 👏 L 👏 E 👏 S 👏

When I first read the spec, I was kinda confused by the syntax and some of the runtime behaviour. But since starting on CSS Modules I’ve realised just how powerful this can be. Since it can’t really be polyfilled, it’s the best thing that CSS has, but that nobody can use.

<span class="strong-border">What’s do you like most about your job?</span>
Before I did CSS, before I did anything front-end, I did back-end Rails stuff. Databases, dev-ops, that sort of thing. Before that I didn’t even work on the web. I was building mathematical modelling software for transport planning. I kept moving because I was frustrated that my work wasn’t directly affecting people — I was too far removed from the end users & their experience. Now the experience, the interactions, the design, that’s all I want to work on. It took me 10 years to get here, but I love it.

<span class="strong-border">What do you like most about giving talks at conferences?</span>
I’ve seen some _incredible_ talks in my time. Talks that have totally convinced me of something, have opened my eyes to a new way of thinking, have revealed to me a depth to a topic I’d been glossing over, have shown me that a technology could do something I’d never imagined. You get 30 minutes of standing in front of all these knowledgeable people and trying to leave them with something. It’s daunting, but addictive.

<span class="strong-border">Do you have any tips for newcomers who want to get into speaking?</span>
My biggest tip is that nobody is a natural speaker. Well, maybe some are, but very few of the speakers you see on stage are any more comfortable than you would be. Each talk is terrifying, the slides are always less prepared than you’d like, the whole experience is exhausting. But it’s also terrific fun, so don’t let nerves stop you!
