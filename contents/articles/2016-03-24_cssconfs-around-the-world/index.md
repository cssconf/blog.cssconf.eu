While over here at CSSconf EU we’re busy planning our 2017 event, there’s no shortage of CSSconf events around the world for you to enjoy in 2016! CSSconf is a [family of conferences](http://cssconf.org/) that share the same values and goals, and our friends in Norway, Hungary, Australia, Singapore and Argentina have you covered this year!

Attending a CSSconf is a fantastic opportunity to use your conference and travel budget to gain new insights, pick up new skills, and meet great like-minded people. Plus, you get the chance to travel to some fabulous places around the globe! Here's what you can look forward to from the [CSSconf community](http://cssconf.org/) in 2016:

### CSSconf Budapest

**MAY 11 2016** | _AKVÁRIUM KLUB_, BUDAPEST, HUNGARY

CSSconf Budapest joins the CSSconf family for the first time in 2016 and will run alongside its bigger sister, JSConf Budapest, this May. Both conferences are part of a week dedicated to celebrating the tech community in one of Europe's most glorious capital cities. CSSconf EU is proud to support CSSconf BP! Our own [Kristina Schneider](www.twitter.com/kriesse) is advising the great organizing team behind CSSconf BP, while [Kevin Lorenz](https://twitter.com/verpixelt) will appear on stage with a talk about Visual Regression Testing for CSS. We recommend you stay the weekend and enjoy Budapest in full bloom this spring! Tickets are available for purchase [NOW](http://cssconfbp.rocks/#tickets).

2016 is a year of firsts and CSSConf Argentina joins the CSSconf family this August in Buenos Aires. While the final details are still being ironed out, we can't wait to see what the organizing team behind the first CSSconf in Latin America will have for us. We are pretty sure it will be nothing short of fantastic.

**NOVEMBER 30 2016** | _MELBOURNE MEAT MARKET_, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA

We were really excited to hear that CSSConf AU is returning in November 2016 and in the company of JSConf AU which shall take place a day later, on December 1. This will be CSSConf AU's third year running, having amassed heaps of great feedback in 2014 and 2015. If you're living in the Northern Hemisphere, we need not tell you how much of a fantastic opportunity escaping to warm Melbourne _in winter_ is. Watch out for fresh batches of tickets!
